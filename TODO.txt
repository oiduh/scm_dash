                        - [X] correct backend
                        -> must be unique name across all variables
                        -> cannot have same name as id
                        -> must start with letter
                        -> cannot exceed e.g. 16 letters

                    - [X] viewer
                        -> rethink whole process:
                        -> generating new data for each mininal change too much?
                        -> test how quick this works
                        -> how to display distribution and sub distribution separately and nicely
                        -> new final idea: return all sub distributions indidually and process them
                           when creating the view
                           we should have 2 graphs: 1 combined (all) and 1 with individuals where
                           only the selected has a different color
                    - [X] apply callbacks also to graph stuff -> adding variables to selector

                                - [X] classification - remove class
                                -> at least one class should remain
                                - [X] check formula button
                                -> no individual checks for classification
                                -> change viewer errors if any occur
                                -> display currently confirmed formulas on right
                                   on the left editable version
                                -> confirm also saves the formula from the input
                    - [X] viewer per variable chosen on builder
                        - [X] display initial formulas
                        -> problem with names vs ids
                        -> generally if name availble, use name else id_
                        -> initial values removed, instead add help functionality
                        - [X] latexify formulas
                        -> simple replace or utils function with sympy
                            - [X] fix equals operator for latex
                            -> sympy evaluates by simplifying, but we do not want that
                            -> use parse_expr with param evaluate=False
                            - [X] latexify whole markdown text, not just the formula
                            - [X] also for regression
                        - [X] add help functionality e.g. tooltip
                            - [X] button
                            - [X] collapsible content
                            - [X] toggle callback
                            - [X] useful info 
                            -> available variables (maybe no toggle but fixed)
                            -> all functions
                            -> difference between reg and class
                        - [X] update on each confirm (correct)
                        - [X] display errors

    - [X] data gen tab
        -> no callbacks from previous tabs -> simple
        - [X] lock button -> success if data generated correctly
            - [X] lock generates data
            - [X] if fails -> feedback (only mechanism can fail)
            - [X] if success -> lock previous tabs, button becomes unlock, tabs unlocked
            - [X] feedback for successfully generated data
        - [X] new dummy tabs for locked graph -> locked initially, unlocked by button
        - [X] viewer just shows success or fail
        -> main task is locking tabs and generating data

    - [ ] data summary tab
    -> probably no 2 half windows with builder and viewer
    -> remove same seed since it ruins it
        - [X] show simple table from df
        -> not that useful?
        - [X] data needs to be written to some internal state, None if failed or unlocked
        - [X] correlation table (heatmap)
            -> types of correlations e.g. spearman, pearson, kendall tau
            -> dash figure + plotly heatmap (similar to distr)
            -> scatter matrix is nice -> keep as option
            -> looks nice, but possible for more types
        - [X] pairwise comparison of variables
            -> 2 dropdowns for each variable
            -> scatter plot
            -> variables bubble chart
            -> very nice for many variables
        - [X] more data analysis options
            -> regression vs classification tools e.g. charts, class distribution
            -> just show pands table with export of raw data
            -> not yet since no decent ideas
        - [ ] graph
            - [X] just show graph with layout options
            - [ ] callback for layout options
            -> fix initial view (all nodes in corner)
            - [ ] hover over nodes for distribution
            - [ ] hover over edges for mechanism formula
            - [ ] move around node
            - [ ] reset button -> back to layout
        - [ ] export functions
            -> further analysis on your own
            -> export data generation process
            -> export raw data
            -> both
            -> export zip with all images + data
        - [ ] required plot options
            - [X] scatter matrix
            -> with proper proportions
            - [X] heatmap
            - [X] 1:1 scatter plot with dropdown
            - [ ] graph with hover data

    - [ ] lock in for ML
        -> rough idea: select target and source variables (variables can be ignored)
        -> create multiple instances of data for comparison e.g. data with certain variable vs. data without certain variable
        -> intervention option? just set some variable to a fixed value
 


    - [ ] fixes
        - [ ] add logger to all controllers
        - [ ] graph
            - [X] respect the maximum size of the defaults
            -> reproduce: max out slider and then change -> result: cannot go back to default max (uniform)
            - [ ] all distribution types update short description about parameters
            - [ ] general distributions
            -> instead of making 'random' values for limit to some uniform values
            -> scaling can be done in the mechanism part
            -> need to know which variables to limit, which not
            -> might be useful for uniform distribution where we can just keep a constant
        - [ ] mechanism
            - [ ] when data already generated and locked -> keep state when reloading
        - [ ] lock data
            - [ ] think about adding seed (could also be added to noise?)
            - [ ] handling names instead of ids 
            - [ ] color coding for visualisations for classification

	- [ ] graph state as file
    -> simple json
		- [ ] export import from meta files
		-> no exact data points, just meta data for generation + seed
		-> export/save files (reproducible results)
		- [ ] import feature -> parser + validation
	- [ ] info/help for mechanism
		- [ ] how to use e.g. numpy standard
        - [ ] available mathematical functions
		- [ ] which variables available
	- [ ] mechanism layout
		- [ ] show info button main + highlight
		- [ ] overall design
			- [ ] mechanism choice
			- [ ] variables highlighted
			- [ ] mechanism input
	- [ ] mechanism feedback
		- [ ] confirm mechanism -> which variables affected
		-> no detailed feedback (overkill)
		- [ ] flag for confirmation of all variables (for summary)
    - [ ] summary view
	-> needs confirmed and valid mechanism
		- [ ] dag
			- [ ] all nodes and edges 
			- [ ] hover node -> noise
			- [ ] hover edge -> mechansim (text)
		- [ ] confirm base graph -> exportable data + metadata
	- [ ] intervention
	-> needs base metadata
	-> multiple iteration possible (1 base, multiple interventions)
	-> at least one variable needs to be intervened on
	-> intervention = constant for variable (no distr)


ideas for mechanism view:
    - check list -> which mechanisms are correct, which are not
    - display mechanism/function in a nice way

after mechanism done:
    - lock in scm -> evaluate mechanisms and generate data
    - if date is successfully generated -> enable new window
    - else generic message to check mechansims

next window:
    - data view
    - dimensionality reduction of whole data
    - pairwise correlation view

next window:
    - select target variable
    - select source variables (all by default -> enables to ignore potential problem vars)
