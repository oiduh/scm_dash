                        - [X] correct backend
                        -> must be unique name across all variables
                        -> cannot have same name as id
                        -> must start with letter

                    - [X] viewer
                        -> rethink whole process:
                        -> generating new data for each mininal change too much?
                        -> test how quick this works
                        -> how to display distribution and sub distribution separately and nicely
                        -> new final idea: return all sub distributions indidually and process them
                           when creating the view
                           we should have 2 graphs: 1 combined (all) and 1 with individuals where
                           only the selected has a different color
                    - [X] apply callbacks also to graph stuff -> adding variables to selector
                    - [X] callback logs
                    - [X] fix tests

                    - [ ] graph
                        - [X] respect the maximum size of the defaults
                        -> reproduce: max out slider and then change -> result: cannot go back to default max (uniform)
                        - [ ] all distribution types update short description about parameters
                        - [ ] general distributions
                        -> instead of making 'random' values for limit to some uniform values
                        -> scaling can be done in the mechanism part
                        -> need to know which variables to limit, which not
                        -> might be useful for uniform distribution where we can just keep a constant
            - [ ] button to add variable
            - [ ] button to remove variable

	- [ ] graph state as file
    -> simple json
		- [ ] export import from meta files
		-> no exact data points, just meta data for generation + seed

		- [ ] import feature -> parser + validation

		- [ ] overall design
			- [ ] mechanism choice

		- [ ] flag for confirmation of all variables (for summary)
    - [ ] summary view
	-> needs confirmed and valid mechanism
		- [ ] dag
			- [ ] all nodes and edges 
			- [ ] hover node -> noise
			- [ ] hover edge -> mechansim (text)
		- [ ] confirm base graph -> exportable data + metadata
	- [ ] intervention
	-> needs base metadata
	-> multiple iteration possible (1 base, multiple interventions)
	-> at least one variable needs to be intervened on
	-> intervention = constant for variable (no distr)


ideas for mechanism view:
    - check list -> which mechanisms are correct, which are not
    - display mechanism/function in a nice way

after mechanism done:
    - lock in scm -> evaluate mechanisms and generate data
    - if date is successfully generated -> enable new window
    - else generic message to check mechansims

next window:
    - data view
    - dimensionality reduction of whole data
    - pairwise correlation view

next window:
    - select target variable
    - select source variables (all by default -> enables to ignore potential problem vars)
